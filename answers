Questions:
2) How many rid nodes are there with no edges?

	MATCH (r:rid) 
	WHERE NOT (r)-[]-() 
	RETURN COUNT(r) AS C;

	There are 0 rid nodes with no edges


3) How many cid nodes have more than one edge to an oid node?

	MATCH (c:cid)-[]-(:oid) 
	WITH c, COUNT(*) AS cnt 
	WHERE cnt > 1 
	RETURN COUNT(c) AS C;
	
	There are 810 cid nodes with more than one edge to an oid node


4) Are there any rid nodes with multiple cid nodes? If so, what percent?

	MATCH (c:cid)-[]-(:oid) 
	MATCH (r:rid) 
	WITH COUNT(r) AS cr 
	MATCH (c:rid)-[]-(:cid) 
	WITH cr, c, COUNT(*) AS cnt 
	WHERE cnt > 1 
	WITH cr, COUNT(c) AS cc 
	RETURN cc AS C, 100.0 * cc / cr AS C1;

	There are 52 rid nodes with multiple cid nodes, which is 3.74909877433% of all rid nodes
